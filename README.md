## GGC Raspberry PI Projector
Here at GGC, we have a lab designed for students who want to achieve greatness with technology. It is known as the DM Lab.
In that lab there are tons of things to create and expriment with. We chose to create a projector using a PI. With this, faculty, students, etc. could
upload their own images and have it projected for others in the DM Lab to see.
